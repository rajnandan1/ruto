# Ruto

Ruto is a lightweight(4KB), fast and easy-to-use JS library that streamlines the communication between parent and child window(iframe/popup).

It uses client-server design pattern to communicate between parent and child window. Any window can become the client or the server depending on who wants to send. It abstracts out the complications of postMessage API and provides a simple API to send and receive messages.


## Scenarios where it can be used

1. Parent window wants to send a message to child window and wants to wait for the response from the child window.
2. Parent window wants to send a message to child window and expects a reply within x seconds.
